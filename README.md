## Premise

Helping users track their golf rounds. They can track their rounds by inputing strokes on each hole. Each hole "view" will give information about the hole. At any time a user can view statistics about their own performance on the hole and on that course.

## User Stories

 - As a user, I want to add strokes or subtract strokes from a current hole.
 - As a user, I want to see statistics on the current hole I am playing. Average score, best score, etc.
  - As a user, I want to store my rounds for later reference.


## Technologies Used

-   Django
- Python
-  React.js
- Redux
-   PostgresSQL
-   JavaScript
-  CSS Frameworks (Skeleton & Normalize)
- GIT/GitHub

## Future Goals

 - User Auth
 - Utilizing graphs to display user rounds
 - Better styling.
 - GPS Feature for tracking point on course and automatic switching of holes (pipe dream goal)
